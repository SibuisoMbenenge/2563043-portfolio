# Lab 1 Report

## What I Learned

1. **Git and GitHub Basics**: I learned how to create a repository on GitHub and clone it to my computer. This helps me save my code online and work on it from anywhere.

2. **Version Control**: I practiced using Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to save my work. I understand that commits are like save points for my code.

3. **Branching and Merging**: I created a branch called `feature/student-details` to work on new features without breaking my main code. Then I learned how to merge it back to the main branch.

4. **Semantic HTML**: I discovered that using tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` makes websites easier to understand for both people and computers. This is better than using too many `<div>` tags.

5. **GitHub Pages**: I deployed my website for free using GitHub Pages, so anyone can view my portfolio online.

This lab helped me understand how real developers manage their code and build websites properly.
